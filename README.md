# Group Project: Astrology App

## Description
In this project, we worked with two API's and a CSS framework called Foundation to create an app that will display your daily horoscope given your star sign, and also tell you if Mercury was, is, or will be in retrograde given a date. 

### Technologies Used 
jQuery

Foundation CSS Framework

Ohmanda Horoscope API

Mercury Retrograde API



### Project Requirements
Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

Use at least two server-side APIs.

Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

Be responsive.

Have a polished UI.

Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
